# GitHubSearch

A more awesome way to search GitHub repositories than github.com's official search.

See it in production at [https://salty-beyond-55867.herokuapp.com/](https://salty-beyond-55867.herokuapp.com/)

### Development

* React/Redux on the frontend
  * [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) w/ inline styles
  * CSS Modules
* Simple Express app on the backend
* Webpack for build process

All frontend code is in the `app` folder, all backend code in `server`.

Based on [choonkending's great boilerplate](https://github.com/choonkending/react-webpack-node).

### Testing

```

```

### Run it yourself

```
to start the development server

```
